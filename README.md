## Playlists from Liked Songs. 

This project takes all of your liked songs on spotify, groups them by the year and month you liked them
and then creates playlists on your account for each group.

### Why?
Honestly, idk. This is me procrastinating and not doing my university assignments.

### How to run it?
- install requirements mentioned in the requirements.txt file. 
- copy config.ini.sample to config.ini.
- replace values in config file to your own spotify client id and secret.
- python main.py
- Approve the spotify oauth screen.
- Profit.

If you run it again, it wont duplicate the playlists. Instead it will add the new songs you like to the top of the existing playlist. Makes it look nicer. Ya know.
